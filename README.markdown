#Naow

Naow is a simple one page HTML5 todolist manager that uses Html 5 localstorage. It's designed to be very responsive and used primarily through keyboard navigation and shortcuts.

###Installation and Browsers

**Firefox:** firefox doesn't support(yet) localStorage retention between page visits for domains starting with **file:///** So to use with firefox, host it as a static file on a http server.
**Chrome:** you can launch naow from the local filesystem on chrome or use it from a http server of your choice.
**IE:** Fuck IE

###Keyboard shortcuts

	n - create new todo list (type todolist name and hit return)
	c - create new todo on the selected list (edit and hit return)
	Up and Down arrow keys - select a todo item
	i or insert - edit selected todo
	del - delete selected todo item
	
###Other features

- Todo lists are sortable
- Hover over todos to select it
- Click on todo to edit todo
